I create a docker file for status page and nginx.
I build 4 containers- redis, postgressql, nginx, statuspage
I change:
        nginx.conf- change the path of static to /app/nginx/static/
        You can find this in nginx-new branch

        configuration.py - I enter the ip of the EC2 instance for the redis and postgressql 
        when we create the rds and elastic cache we need to chack the ips...
